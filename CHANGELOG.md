## Changed
- Update commons-codec to 1.17.2

- Start using Github Actions for running tests across a matrix of ubuntu, macos, windows & java 8, 11, 16, 17

### Changed

### Notes
- An intermediate unreleased version had an attempt at (constant) time safe
  comparision of tokens introduced in #11. This change introduced a subtle
  vulnerability (see #12 for details). The following commits in the `main`
  branch are vulnerable:

  * d69435b4d91769a8f84ecd0e32ebda607fc9de85
  * 60d161c525a1b750fff28d4adcc5c2cc7597cf4c
  * 86a90eb55103fbebb878a8be2208433825bec0ed

  We've searched GitHub to make sure nobody is using these.
